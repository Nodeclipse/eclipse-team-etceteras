<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Remote Project Configuration Plug-in provides functionality to configure projects within the workspace using a a very simple, shell script like command file. This so called Eclipse Project Configuration Script (EPCS) file is either fetched using a HTTP transfer or from a local file.
</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>
The project configuration process consists of two to three logical steps:
  <ol>
    <li>If multiple EPCS scripts are configured, the user is prompted to select to one to run.</li>
    <li>Fetch the EPCS script from a web server using HTTP or a local file.</li>
    <li>Execute the commands of the script file on the selected projects.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Applying Remote Project Properties</h2>
<p>
Provided at least one valid URL to a EPCS file is configured, the following steps initiate a project configuration:
  <ul>
    <li>Select one or more projects in the Package Explorer.</li>
    <li>Run the command Apply Default Properties to Projectfrom the context menu.</li>
    <li>If multiple scripts are configured, the user is prompted to select the one to execute.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Creating a Project Configuration Configuration File</h2>
<p>
Eclipse Project Configuration Script (EPCS) files are plain text files that are organized in lines. A line may contain either a comment, nothing at all or exactly one command. The basic syntax can be seen in the following diagram and each command it is described in detail below:

<h3>Supported Commands</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#</code></td>
    <td>Lines starting with the character '#' are treated as comment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>mkdir DIRECTORY</code></td>
    <td>Creates the DIRECTORY if it does not already exist. The path to the DIRECTORY is relative to the project root.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>rm FILE</code></td>
    <td>Deletes the FILE if it exists. The path to the FILE is relative to the project root. Directories must be deleted with the rmdir command.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>rmdir DIRECTORY</code></td>
    <td>Deletes the empty DIRECTORY if it exists. The path to the DIRECTORY is relative to the project root.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>download [overwrite] SOURCE to FILE</code></td>
    <td>Downloads the SOURCE to the FILE if the FILE does not already exist. The SOURCE must be a valid URL and FILE a filename relative to the project root. To replace a possibly existing FILE, use the optional overwrite parameter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>addnature NATUREID</code></td>
    <td>Adds the nature defined by NATUREID to the projects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>removeature NATUREID</code></td>
    <td>Removes the nature defined by NATUREID to the projects.</td>
  </tr>
</table>



<h3>Example File</h3>
<p>
The following example EPCS file shows some cases used to test the plug-in:
</p>
<pre>
  # sample project configuration command (epcs) file
 
  # mkdir on not existing directory
  mkdir testdir
 
  # mkdir on existing directory
  mkdir existingdir
 
  # download file not existing in target
  download http://www.foo.com/test/test.file to testdir/test.file
  
  # download file existing in target (don't overwrite)
  download http://www.foo.com/test/test.file to test.file
 
  # download file existing in target (overwrite)
  download overwrite http://www.foo.com/test/test.file to test.file
 
  # delete file
  rm testdir/test.file
 
  # delete not existing file
  rm testdir/bla.file
 
  # delete directory
  rmdir testdir
</pre>

<h2>Preferences</h2>

<h3>Workspace Preferences</h3>
<p>
The behavior of the Remote Project Preference plug-in can be configured in the Eclipse preferences dialog. Open the dialog from the <code>Window > Preferences</code> menu. The settings are located on the <code>General > Remote Project Properties</code> page.
</p>
<p>
List of project configuration script URLs: Add, remove or edit the URLs of the EPCS files to the list using the buttons to the right. The editing itself is done in a separate dialog that will pop up. The protocolls supported are http(s):// and file://. The URLs need to comply with the following rules:
  <ul>
    <li>Each URL may only be added once to the list</li>
    <li>The URL must start with either <code>'http'</code>, <code>'https'</code> or <code>'file'</code></li>
    <li>The URL must not contain the hash-character <code>'#'</code></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Default Settings</h3>
<p>
There are no built-in default settings, but you may provide them by editing the property file <code>$ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/ch.netcetera.eclipse.projectconfig.ui.fragment_$VERSION_&crarr; /ch.netcetera.eclipse.projectconfig.ui.fragment/default.properties</code>.
</p>
<p>
Command File URL Configure a default using the property key <code>project.config.url</code>. Multiple URLs are separated by the character <code>#</code>. The character <code>#</code> itself is therefore unsupported within URLs.
</p>
